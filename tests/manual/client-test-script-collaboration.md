# Tests

Open 2 different browsers, login as different users

1. Add/Remove Collaborators
As the script owner (1st account), add or remove the other account as a 
collaborator from the share menu. Also try renaming the script. Check it in the 
other account's browser.

2. Collaborator's View
As a collaborator (2nd account), check if the script is added to / removed 
from the shared-script browser. Try leaving the collaboration by hitting the 
"Delete" button in the browser.

3. Simultaneous Editing
Check the script editing, cursor moving and selecting are reflected to the 
other account's view. Try to create real-time edit conflicts if doable, and 
see if it is automatically resolved. If not (with unresolved sync errors), 
try to reproduce.

4. Collaborator Live Status
Open, switch tabs, or close the collaborative script. Check if the person 
"enters" or "exits" the collaborative session in the other account's view.

5. Log out
Log out while the collaborative script is open. Check if the person properly 
exists and has no access to the collaborative session.

6. Save
Save script versions by CMD+S (CTRL+S) or compiling as the owner. See if you 
can revert the script to a previous version.
